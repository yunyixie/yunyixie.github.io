		This is LEVEL 3 B

		A few mega–corporations inflict this culture on us. Their virtual monopoly of
		TV, fashion, pop and rock‘n’roll music, cable, theatre, magazines and film,
		etc., is designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator which,
		in turn, allows them to merchandise the most stuff: Obama action figures and
		Kelly Clarkson t–shirts, for example. Of course, the establishment allows just
		enough high culture to prove that they’re not only Philistines. How can you
		extricate yourself from this avalanche of white–bread, so that you can be an original
		thinker? First purge your mind of as much cultural baggage as possible. When
		you get a job, regardless of how familiar the subject, resist any temptation
		to think you know enough about it, and that you’re ready to design.
