      <h3>Stop trying to make the web look 'beautiful' – <br>I've forgotten it already</h3>
  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hear the word "beautiful" all the time, these days, when web design's being discussed. Medium, the blogging platform created by the Twitter co-founder Ev Wiliams, was conceived to be "simple [and] beautiful". Likewise Svbtle, another "beautiful" stripped-down publishing system, was designed to "get out of the way". This is the aesthetic of Jony Ive's iOS7, with its flat icons and defiant lack of adornment; it's an aesthetic for a world that does its reading on smooth pieces of black glass with curved corners. It's the aesthetic that's rapidly coming to dominate the web – which is why I feel some nervousness in poking my head above the parapet to say: what if I don't want my reading experience to be this beautiful?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes, of course this is partly just the ranting of a decreasingly young web user, disgruntled by change. But it isn't only that. There's some evidence to suggest that when you make the reading experience too smooth and glossy and beautiful, you make it less engaging and satisfying, too. The key concept here, explored in depth by the psychologist Adam Alter, author of the book Drunk Tank Pink, is "cognitive disfluency". When information glides by too frictionlessly, we're liable to find it harder both to understand and to retain.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not really suggesting that online publishers should deliberately employ awful fonts. But I doubt I'm alone in feeling a certain satisfaction when what I'm reading is presented in a non-beautiful way. It's hard to describe. But for some reason (linked to cognitive disfluency?) there's a greater sense of getting purchase on the material, of getting the meat of it between my teeth.</p>

      <br>-<h3>The Benefits of Cognitive Disfluency</h3>
      <h4>Deeper processing</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When we printed the questions in standard 12-point font, participants answered an average of 63% of the questions correctly. In contrast, when we made the process of reading the questions more disfluent, by printing them in a gray, italicized, 10-point font, participants scored an average of 82% (and committed 56% fewer intuitive errors). Researchers have also shown that people process information more deeply when they experience cognitive disfluency in other contexts (see Fig. 1). For example, when asked how many animals of each kind Moses took aboard the ark, 90% of people erroneously respond with two (Erickson & Mattson, 1981;Reder & Kusbit, 1991; Song & Schwarz, 2008). The correct answer is none, because Moses was not associated with the ark, but people succumb to this so-called Moses illu- sion despite declaring later that Noah built and sailed the ark. The illusion traps most people because they glide fluently over the name Moses, and focus instead on how many animals boarded the ark. In contrast, Song and Schwarz (2008) found that the error rate fell from 88% to 53% when they presented the question in a disfluent 12-point gray Brush Script font. When the researchers repeated the experiment, asking a separate sample of participants what sort of animal swallowed Joshua in the biblical story, 40% succumbed to the illusion when the question was printed clearly, whereas only 23% failed to notice that the whale swallowed Jonah, not Joshua, when the questions were printed in the disfluent font. People are more likely to reconsider their misleading intuitions when they encounter mental roadblocks (see also Simmons & Nelson, 2006).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The benefits of disfluency apply beyond illusions and parlor tricks, and disfluent processing sometimes stimu- lates significant real-world value. In one study, students in six advanced-placement classes at a school in Ohio learned new material from worksheets and PowerPointslides (Diemand-Yauman, Oppenheimer, & Vaughn, 2011). The experimenters randomly assigned certain sec- tions of each class to learn the material from fluent or disfluent versions of the same worksheets. The fluent ver- sions were printed in a standard font, whereas the disflu- ent versions were printed in one of four harder-to-read formats. When the students completed their exams, those who had learned from the disfluent materials achieved significantly higher scores. These striking results repli- cated an earlier laboratory experiment in which college students remembered new information about a fictitious alien race more accurately when the information was presented disfluently.</p>

      <br>-<h3>Clean? Cluttered? Classy? The state of online editorial design</h3>
      <br>-<h3>Adam Alter: 'Can't follow this column? Try changing the typeface'</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should printing the question in fuzzy letters make a difference? It turns out that we assume the task is difficult and requires additional mental effort when the font is hard to read. We respond by recruiting additional mental resources to overcome that challenge, and our responses tend to be more accurate. In fact, this effect holds across a wide range of situations. For example, some of my colleagues and I have shown that people are less likely to rely on simplifying stereotypes when they're asked to furrow their brows. Like fuzzy fonts, a furrowed brow suggests that the task must be difficult, encouraging the person who adopts the expression to think more deeply before reaching a conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Replacing simplicity with complexity has other benefits. In one experiment, students in English, physics and chemistry classes at a public high school in Ohio achieved higher scores when their textbooks were printed in a disfluent font rather than a standard, clear one. In other experiments, we found that people completed mental puzzles more accurately and read a product review more closely when the materials were printed disfluently.

        <br>-<h3>An Eye Tracking Study of How Font Size and Type Influence Online Reading</h3>
        </div>
    -<h4>EXPLANATION</h4>
    <div class="body">
      <p>
      My chosen texts are about online reading experience. I want the audience to feel the impact of different fonts and typesetting on the reading experienc.</p></div>
    -<h4>QUESTIONS</h4>
     <div class="body">
       <p>
      1. How would you describe your online reading experience as and not as a designer?<br>
      2. Do you have any suggestion for my text selection? <br>
      3. Which one do you think would make a better comparison, a website that is split into half or a button that can let you switch between 'clean&beautiful'/'ugly(?)'?</p>
