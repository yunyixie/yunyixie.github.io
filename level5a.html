		This is LEVEL 5 A
		Take a statement like, “we cure cancer for one dollar.” It isn’t necessary
		to make those words look interesting. They are interesting. If you try to
		make interesting words look interesting, the way they look competes with
		their meaning. Also. if you want to draw attention to an interesting image,
		the words that accompany it shouldn’t be unusual. 

    Design is problem–solving.
