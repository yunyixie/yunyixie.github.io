		This is LEVEL 5 B

    Most designers are not very interested in problem–solving. They’re more interested
		in producing work that looks good. That’s like the mathematician who, before knowing
	  the problem, knows that the answer is 128. Designers who know their solution must 
		 consist of lots of white space, and a particular typeface, etc., before they know
		 the problem, are just like the mathematician who knows that the answer is 128.

		What is good design is what communicates best in an original way, even though it doesn’t conform to our preconceptions of good design.
