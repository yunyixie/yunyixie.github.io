			<li>Designers have to do things that <em>a typist with a computer <strong>can’t</strong> do</em>. </li>
			<br>
			<li>Assume that <em>all of the information and imagery was <strong>supplied by the culture</strong></em>,
			that <em>none of the information or imagery is original</em>.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Research the subject</strong> <em>as if you know nothing about it.</em></li>
			<br>
			<li>And don’t stop until you have <em>something interesting</em>, or even better, <em><strong>something
			original</strong></em> to say. That’s the most likely way of producing an original image.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The design process can <em>begin only after you are <strong>satisfied with the statement.</strong></em></li>
			<br>
			<li><em>Listen to the statement.</em> It will design itself.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Design is problem–solving.</strong> </li>
			<br>
			<li>What is good design is what <strong>communicates best in an original way,</strong>
				 <em>even though it doesn’t conform to our preconceptions of good design.</em></li>
			 <br>
			 <li><strong>No image or color or typeface is always good or always bad.</strong>
				  What makes it
	 		good is if it’s the best image or color or typeface that <em>says exactly what
	 		you want to say.</em></li>
			<br>
			
			<li>Otherwise forget it.</li>
