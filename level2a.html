		This is LEVEL 2 A

		That, to me, is more exciting than the most amazing special effects. And
		thereâ€™s another thing about the situation today that graphic designers
		must recognize. Before computers, the production of printed matter was
		IN THE HANDS OF DESIGNERS AND PRINTERS.

		And they were prepared to pay well for their logos, newsletters,
		brochures and other business paper.
