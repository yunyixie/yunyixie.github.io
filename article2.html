      Humans fall prey to the “yolk phenomenon” and similar cognitive shortcomings in part because they are cognitive misers, preferring to process information as superficially as possible while reaching minimally acceptable conclusions (Fiske & Taylor, 1991). One solution, then, is to introduce cognitive roadblocks that signal a need for deeper processing. For example, participants in oneexperiment (Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, & Eyre, 2007, Experiment 1) completed the three-item Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005). Like the opening exam- ple, each question in the Cognitive Reflection Test inspires an incorrect solution that can be corrected only with deliberate reconsideration. According to the first question, “A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?” The intuitive response—the bat costs $1 and the ball costs 10 cents—is incorrect (the difference between these is 90 cents, not $1), and the correct response is that the ball costs 5 cents (and the bat $1.05).
      <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we printed the questions in standard 12-point font, participants answered an average of 63% of the questions correctly. In contrast, when we made the pro- cess of reading the questions more disfluent, by printing them in a gray, italicized, 10-point font, participants scored an average of 82% (and committed 56% fewer intuitive errors). Researchers have also shown that people process information more deeply when they experience cognitive disfluency in other contexts (see Fig. 1). For example, when asked how many animals of each kind Moses took aboard the ark, 90% of people erroneously respond with two (Erickson & Mattson, 1981;
Reder & Kusbit, 1991; Song & Schwarz, 2008). The correct answer is none, because Moses was not associated with the ark, but people succumb to this so-called Moses illu- sion despite declaring later that Noah built and sailed the ark. The illusion traps most people because they glide fluently over the name Moses, and focus instead on how many animals boarded the ark. In contrast, Song and Schwarz (2008) found that the error rate fell from 88% to 53% when they presented the question in a disfluent 12-point gray Brush Script font. When the researchers repeated the experiment, asking a separate sample of participants what sort of animal swallowed Joshua in the biblical story, 40% succumbed to the illusion when the question was printed clearly, whereas only 23% failed to notice that the whale swallowed Jonah, not Joshua, when the questions were printed in the disfluent font. People are more likely to reconsider their misleading intuitions when they encounter mental roadblocks (see also Simmons & Nelson, 2006).
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of disfluency apply beyond illusions and parlor tricks, and disfluent processing sometimes stimulates significant real-world value. In one study, students in six advanced-placement classes at a school in Ohio learned new material from worksheets and PowerPoint slides (Diemand-Yauman, Oppenheimer, & Vaughn, 2011). The experimenters randomly assigned certain sec- tions of each class to learn the material from fluent or disfluent versions of the same worksheets. The fluent ver- sions were printed in a standard font, whereas the disflu- ent versions were printed in one of four harder-to-read formats. When the students completed their exams, those who had learned from the disfluent materials achieved significantly higher scores. These striking results repli- cated an earlier laboratory experiment in which college students remembered new information about a fictitious alien race more accurately when the information was presented disfluently.
