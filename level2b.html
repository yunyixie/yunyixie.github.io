		This is LEVEL 2 B

		Now, for very little money, it’s possible to buy a program which allows
		<h3>anyone</h3> with a computer to produce most of the stuff for the average business.
		<h1>THE MYSTIQUE HAS FINALLY GONE OUT OF ORDINARY DESIGN AND PRINT.</h1>
		These programs fit words and images into slick professional looking formats.
		 And for low–end commercial needs, that’s perfectly fine. So, if a typist
		 can do much of the work previously done by well–paid specialists,
		  what’s left for the designer?
