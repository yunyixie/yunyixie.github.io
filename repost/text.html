Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts (1962-1965)

Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts was an absolutely vital literary magazine
<br>founded in 1962 by the poet Ed Sanders and published from a “secret location
<br> on the Lower East Side” of New York City. Probably the most important mimeo
<br>revolution publication. Sanders’ Peace Eye Bookstore was raided by police on
<br>January 1, 1966 and Saunders was charged with obscenity in no small part due
<br>to the contents of Fuck You. Notoriety generated by the case led to his
<br>appearance on the February 17, 1967 cover of Life Magazine, which proclaimed
<br>him "a leader of New York's Other Culture."
