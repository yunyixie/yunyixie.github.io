		This is LEVEL 3 A

		And, unfortunately, thinking is not the designer’s first love. They love choosing colors, pushing type and shapes around, drawing in a particular style and imposing the latest graphic tricks on their next job, regardless of whether they are appropriate or not.

    They get these tricks from the culture. Most designers spend their time trying
		to emulate what’s supposed to be hot, what’s current, what’s trendy.
		But just think, if we want to do something the computer in the hands of a
		non–designer can’t do, something that’s original, how can we rely on what
		 the culture tells us? (The culture tells all of us the same thing.)
